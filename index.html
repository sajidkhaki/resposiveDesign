			<p>It is especially important to submit this assignment before the deadline, March 26, 11:59 PM PDT, because 
			it must be graded by others. If you submit late, there may not be enough classmates around to review your work. 
			This makes it difficult - and in some cases, impossible - to produce a grade. Submit on time to avoid these risks.
